		Identify any submissions with STATUS_PUBLISHED that are missing a corresponding entry
		in the published_submissions table and reset them to STATUS_QUEUED. In the past, an
		entry in published_submissions was required before a submission would be public. Now
		it will be public if it has a status of STATUS_PUBLISHED. A submission should never
		have STATUS_PUBLISHED without a published_submissions entry, but this is a
		precautionary measure to prevent unexpectedly making a submission public if the
		status value is incorrect for any submissions.
